# Google Calendar Clone with TypeScript and React

This was the first project I built using TypeScript and React by way of vite. Types and PropTypes were completely new to me but I am much more confident after taking the TypeScript course offered by [WebDevSimplified](https://courses.webdevsimplified.com/).

The app is pretty straight forward. All of the styles are custom, as well as the animation creating an event. It uses the date-fns library to help manipulate dates and uses local storage to persist data through refreshes.

A user can save and edit events to any given calendar day, and set them to either all day or a custom time.

# Usage

To run the app locally, type the command "npm run dev" in the terminal from the root of the project
